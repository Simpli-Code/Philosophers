# Philosophers

This project, is about learning the basics of threading a process and how to create threads and mutexes.

the following has to be considered to succeed this Assignment:

‚Ä¢ One or more philosophers sit at a round table.

‚Ä¢ There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

‚Ä¢ The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.

‚Ä¢ While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;

‚Ä¢ while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping; and of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

‚Ä¢ There are also chopsticks on the table. There is only one single chopstick for each philosopher.

‚Ä¢ Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one chopstick is very inconvenient,
  
  a philosopher takes their right and their left chopstick to eat, one in each hand.

‚Ä¢ When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their chopsticks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.

‚Ä¢ Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

‚Ä¢ Philosophers don‚Äôt speak with each other.

‚Ä¢ Philosophers don‚Äôt know if another philosopher is about to die.

‚Ä¢ No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!

‚Ä¢ Global variables are forbidden!

‚Ä¢ The program should take the following arguments:

    Number_of_philosophers

      Each Philo has one Chopstick

    Time_to_die (in milliseconds)
      
      If a philosopher didn‚Äôt start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning
      of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
      
    Time_to_eat (in milliseconds)
      
      The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two Chopsticks.
      
    Time_to_sleep (in milliseconds)
    
      The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
      
    Number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
      If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times,
      the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

‚Ä¢ Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.

‚Ä¢ Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers.
Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philoso-
pher number N + 1.
