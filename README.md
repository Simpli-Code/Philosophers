# Philosophers

This project, is about learning the basics of threading a process and how to create threads and mutexes.

Consider the following in order to succeed this assignment:

‚Ä¢ One or more philosophers sit at a round table.

‚Ä¢ There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

‚Ä¢ The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.

‚Ä¢ While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;

‚Ä¢ while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping; and of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

‚Ä¢ There are also chopsticks on the table. There is only one single chopstick for each philosopher.

‚Ä¢ Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one chopstick is very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their left chopstick to eat, one in each hand.

‚Ä¢ When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their chopsticks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.

‚Ä¢ Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

‚Ä¢ Philosophers don‚Äôt speak with each other.

‚Ä¢ Philosophers don‚Äôt know if another philosopher is about to die.

‚Ä¢ No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
